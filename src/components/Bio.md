## About Me
I grew up in Manhattan in the 90's in Yorkville. After graduating from Rhode Island School of Design in 2001 I moved back to Brooklyn a few months before 9/11.  
I began work as an Illustrator and inadvertently taught myself to build websites.  

Back then front end was simple.
The first program I used was a WYSIWYG called *Trellis Web*.
It came with AOL or something.  
I graduated to DreamWeaver â†’ HTML â†’ PHP â†’ WordPress.  

For the last 20 years I've designed websites and created WordPress custom themes.  
During the pandemic I started working with Shopify.  
In the last few years I've been discovering the *new* JavaScript based front end paradigm with Vue and now Astro.

I love building websites ðŸ’–  
I love symbolic thinking and the zen of coding.   


## Colophon
This site was created with [**Astro JS 4**](https://astro.build/)  
Most of the transitions are using the new [View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions) which allows content to be animated from one page to the next.

I enjoyed using the component based architecture (though the stylus CSS preprocessor is breaking some of the scoped CSS).  
I've loved the file-based routing and content written in MarkDown.  
Astro is doing the boring stuff so we can focus on the content.



The site is deployed on **Vercel**,   
is versioned controlled on **Github**,  
uses **Tippy** library for Tooltips,  
uses **Lato font**,  
uses **Tailwind** and **Stylus** CSS preprocessors,  
and Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for everything else.
