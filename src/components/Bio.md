## About Me
I grew up in Manhattan in the 90's in Yorkville and went to Stuyvesant, then LaGuardia High School. 
I began work as an Illustrator and inadvertently taught myself to build websites.  
After stints at Bard College and the University of Buenos Aires, I graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in 2001 and moved back to Brooklyn a few months before 9/11.  

Back then Front End was simple.
The first program I used was a WYSIWYG called *Trellis Web*.
It came with AOL or something.  
I graduated to DreamWeaver â†’ HTML â†’ PHP â†’ WordPress.  

For the last 20 years I've **designed** websites and created **WordPress custom themes**.  
During the pandemic I started working with **Shopify**.  
In the last few years I've been discovering the *new* JavaScript based front end paradigm with **Vue** and now **Astro**.

I love building websites ðŸ’–  
I love symbolic thinking and the zen of coding.   
We get to build these little ingenius systems.
