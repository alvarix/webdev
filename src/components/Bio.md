## About Me
I grew up in Manhattan, graduated from *Rhode Island School of Design* in 2001 and moved back to Brooklyn a few months before 9/11.  
I began work as an Illustrator and inadvertently taught myself to build websites.  
Back then Front End was simple  :)  
The first program I used was a WYSIWYG called *Trellis Web*.
It came with AOL or something.  
I graduated to DreamWeaver > custom HTML > PHP > **WordPress**.  
For the last 20 years I've spent most of my time creating WordPress custom themes.  
During the pandemic I started working with **Shopify**.  
In the last few years I've been discovering the *New* JavaScript Front End.
