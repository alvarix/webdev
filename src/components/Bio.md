## About Me
I grew up in Manhattan in the 90's in Yorkville and went to Stuyvesant, then LaGuardia High School. 
I began work as an Illustrator and inadvertently taught myself to build websites.  
After stints at Bard College and the University of Buenos Aires, I graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in 2001 and moved back to Brooklyn a few months before 9/11.  

Back then Front End was simple.
The first program I used was a WYSIWYG called *Trellis Web*.
It came with AOL or something.  
I graduated to DreamWeaver â†’ HTML â†’ PHP â†’ WordPress.  

For the last 20 years I've **designed** websites and created **WordPress custom themes**.  
During the pandemic I started working with **Shopify**.  
In the last few years I've been discovering the *new* JavaScript based front end paradigm with **Vue** and now **Astro**.

I love building websites ðŸ’–  
I love symbolic thinking and the zen of coding.   
We get to build these little ingenius systems.


### Colophon
This site was created with [**Astro JS 4**](https://astro.build/)  
Most of the transitions are using the new [View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions) which allows connect to be animated from one page to the next.

Soome of what I loved:  
- Component based architecture
- Server side statically rendered JavaScript with optional client side 
- View Transitions interface 
- Content-driven development
- Content
  - Collections 
  - File-based routing 
  - MarkDown


The site is deployed on **Vercel**,   
is versioned controlled on **Github**,  
uses **Tippy** library for Tooltips,  
uses **Lato font**,  
uses **Tailwind** and **Stylus** CSS preprocessors,  
and Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for everything else.
