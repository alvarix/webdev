## A Shopify Theme in Vue

While I was working at Roswell Studios during the pandemic the focus was to being organizing themes around Vue.
Each feature was rendered as a vue components as atomically as possible.

Tailwind and BEM class naming conventions worked well to enforce standards and avoid duplication of styling.

One of the components I created was an image/video player with an optional overlay.
### Features:
- editable title and subtitle  (customizer)
- optional poster image for video (customizer)
- color picker for text  (customizer)
- optional mobile version of image/video  (customizer)
- custom play button
