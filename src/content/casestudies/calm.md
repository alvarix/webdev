## A Shopify Theme in Vue

While working at Roswell Studios during the pandemic the leadership's focus was on transitioning their Shopify base theme to a Vue architecture to sync the feature request > PR > Deploy cycle.
Each feature would be rendered as a component as atomically as possible for reusability across projects.  
 I also found Tailwind CSS and BEM class naming conventions worked well to avoid duplication of styling.

One of the components I created was an image/video player with an optional overlay.
### Features:
- editable title and subtitle  (Shopify Customizer)
- optional poster image for video (Shopify Customizer)
- color picker for text  (Shopify Customizer)
- optional mobile version of image/video  (Shopify Customizer)
- custom inline SVG play button
