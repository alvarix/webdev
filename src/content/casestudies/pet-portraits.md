## A Portfolio WordPress Block Theme
Coding is just for fun, my real job is as a Pet Portrait artist.  
JK but it is a real business.  
I created and administered a Shopify storefront for a year,  
but found the overhead high.  
So I decided to move to Etsy and a custom Portfolio website.

Like most devs I've resisted Gutenberg and fretted over the direction of WordPress.  
I understand blocks can add powerful controls over atomic design but it's still difficult to work with.  
Classic is a better choice for most small and mid-sized clients.  

I decided to use this portfolio as a chance to explore Blocks.  
The brief was simple: a portfolio, links to my store and email and a Newsletter sign up form.  

This ACF based block was easy to setup - there are  2 inputs:
1. **Post Type**  
gather all the posts and output their thumbnail into a lightbox gallery.
2. **Top Images**  
Thumbs to push to the front of the gallery.

A few more hand coded features:
1. Lightbox from scratch
2. AJAX fetch full size images and titles
3. Scrolling single page navigation with dynamic navigation
4. Animated header
5. Column count switcher
